CS463G: Intro to Artificial Intelligence
Markov Decision Proceses
11/28/2016

compile with "g++ main.cpp -o MDP" 

what I learned:
Well, obviously I learned about markov decision processes. I think they are extremely interesting, and although it was a bit of a pain to enter the transition tables, I think this example is perfect for MDP. I love programs like this that have a nice visual output, it makes it easy to show off to friends. Side note: I also re-learned a little bit about printf for this program. Formatted printing is so important!!!

favorite thing about 463:
I really enjoyed theorizing about the Atomic Chaos puzzle on the discussion boards. I think that was probably my favorite part of the class. A lot of these later programs felt pretty cut and dry, and I enjoyed how open ended the Atomic Chaos problem felt.
